## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Charles Wyner, and I recently graduated from Georgia Tech with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. My studies have taken me down the paths of Intelligence and Media, so my interests range from Machine Learning and Data Science to Computer Graphics and Video Game design!

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Lead Out Software, helping integrate our lottery gaming systems with new clients to expand outreach!

ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning more about front-end processes like web development.
